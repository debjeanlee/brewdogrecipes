# BREW-yourown-DOG

An app that let's you explore Brewdog's catalogue of recipes.

## Description

This app allows easy access to Brewdog's beer recipes.

Currently, they've released a PDF catalogue of their recipes which I found was very hard to scroll through and tedious to find specific beers, therefore pushing me to create this web app.

The current state of the app allows users to search for individual beers by name, sort by alcohol content, bitterness, or color, search for beers that pair well with different types of food, and is also able to generate a random beer, for the indecisive.
