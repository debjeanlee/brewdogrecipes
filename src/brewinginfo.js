    mashing: `Irrespective of size or scale, every brewday starts
    with the same time-honoured task. And once
    the coffee has been poured, it’s time to get on
    with the brewing. Mashing in is the first stage of
    converting the dry solids into the greatest liquid
    on earth, and it consists of mixing two of the
    fundamental four building blocks of beer together
    – malt and water.

    As the name mashing suggests, this is nothing
    more onerous than combining the two into a
    porridge-like substance; the dry malted barley,
    rye, wheat or other grains mixing together with
    warm water (‘liquor’ to professional brewers or
    homebrewers running a tight ship) to produce a
    glutinous substance that enables the first of many
    chemical reactions to occur.

    This is aided by the crushing of the malt grains
    beforehand, cracking the husks of each individual
    kernel to allow the water a chance to get at the
    soluble starches. Left to their own devices, these
    starches would be used by the seed to provide a
    food source for the growing plant it would create,
    but brewers are after the precious sugars to feed
    something of their own – yeast – later down in the
    brewday pathway.

    For now, the sweet, starchy liquid – known as wort
    – is run off by the brewer into another vessel in
    time for the second stage of the process. Kettle on.`,

    boiling: `Once the wort runs clear from the mash tun it is
    pumped into another vessel and heated to a vigorous
    rolling boil. Once reached, the enzymes that were
    busy breaking down the starches are stopped dead
    in their tracks, giving the brewer a known (and
    measureable) quantity of sugars to feed their yeast
    with later. A further outcome of boiling is that the
    wort becomes sterile, as anything pumped into
    the fermentation vessels has to be free of spoiling
    bacteria (if you want beer that tastes like beer).

    The boiling stage isn’t just about applying heat - it
    is also the moment when another key part of the
    process occurs. The third member of beers’ Fab Four
    makes its appearance when things heat up; the hops
    are added into the brew. Carefully introduced into
    the rolling boil in batches, with specific timings, the
    heated wort releases the alpha and beta acids in the
    hops, giving a beer its character – and its variety.

    With hundreds of different hops available to brewers
    the flavour profiles and bitterness levels are nearendless. This process – known as isomerisation – has
    time as a key influence. The longer it is in the boil,
    the more a hop adds to the boil. So fistfuls (or
    container loads) added at the start of the process
    give bitterness to the beer, those introduced later on
    give more delicate aromas and flavours to the final
    result.`,

    fermentation: `After the heat, next up is the cold. The wort is cooled
    and moved on once again to the vessel where it will
    remain for the longest period of time in the entire
    process. The brewer also hands things over at this
    stage, as they unleash the power of an army numbering
    in the tens of millions. As the enzymes have finished
    their work and exposed a food source, it is now time for
    the yeast to truly feast.

    Once ‘pitched’ into action, they consume the sugars
    and multiply at an astounding rate. When their appetite
    is combined with a perfect set of food-rich conditions
    (as the brewer should have created for them) yeast get
    to it with such abandon that the resultant beer foams
    up over the side of steel vessels you could stand in
    and never see the top of. The power these simple fungi
    unleash is the most amazing part of the entire brewing
    process.

    Yeast take in the sugars and convert them into ethanol
    and CO2, another reason for the foaming, until they
    have exhausted the food source and begin to die off.
    With hundreds of different strains of yeast available,
    and each one yielding and adding characteristic
    flavours and aromas to the beer, the brewer can still
    retain control of their impact on the final beer, even as
    they multiply before their eyes.`,

    conditioning: `There is still one more basic stage of brewing to go,
    however – and returning to our cooking analogy it
    would be similar to resting meat before carving. Just as
    that gives a roast a chance to settle out and loosen up,
    becoming more flavourful, the conditioning stage gives
    the finished beer a chance to develop its flavour profile
    to exactly how the brewer wants following the raging
    fury of the yeast party that is the fermentation stage.

    Conditioning can last from several days through to
    weeks, depending on the style of beer. If a brewer or
    (lucky) homebrewer has access to barrels it can then
    be prolonged for months or even years. The maturation
    stage starts off to let the remaining yeast reabsorb
    some of the unwanted by-products of fermentation and
    also for unwanted proteins, dead yeast cells and hop
    debris to sink to the bottom of the vessel where it can
    be removed.
    
    This can either be done naturally over time or through
    the introduction of a fining agent that causes these
    particles to clump together and become heavier that
    the surrounding suspension, and thus drift downwards.
    Or you can build a kick-ass centrifuge – it’s totally
    up to you. Naturally hazy or downright cloudy beers
    often reduce or bypass this procedure, leading to
    classic styles (Hefeweizen) – but all beer needs to be
    conditioned until everything has reached a peak and it’s
    ready to go.`
